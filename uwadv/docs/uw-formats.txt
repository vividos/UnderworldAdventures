1  Introduction

   This file tries to collect all file formats and data structures used in the
   game Ultima Underworld 1. It origined from the "uw-specs.txt" file that I
   found with "The System Shock Hack Project" (TSSHP). System Shock uses
   almost the same data structures for the game and Jim decided to support the
   underworldly games, too. With the start of the Underworld Adventures
   project I started to extend the file as I found new things. It started with
   a tiny 20kb text file.

   As I further progressed to find out things I realized that the Underworld
   games are not that simple done as I always thought. Many little things want
   to be specified, configured and set. The Underworld games were built very
   detailed, far more than other games at this time. The second game even
   added to that complexity (and some say, story, too).

   With this document I hope to present the interested reader a rather
   detailed overview over the file formats, and even more the inner workings
   of Ultima Underworld 1 and 2. Have as much fun reading it as I had fun to
   find out things and writing it!


1.1  Credits

   My thanks go out to Jim Cameron that started the original "uw-specs.txt"
   file and subsequently found out more unknown data structures and discussed
   about file formats with me. Many thanks, Jim!

   Additional information came from:
   - Alistair Brown (basic object format, via the Underworld II editor
     available at http://bearcity.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/)
   - Ulf Wohlers (Objects and 3D models)
   - Fabian Pache (about map details and 3d models, uw2 conversations uw2
     player save http://uw2rev.sourceforge.net)
   - Hank Morgan, from his UnderworldExporter project
     https://github.com/hankmorgan/UnderworldExporter.
   - Marc A. Pelletier (coren), from the Labyrinth of Worlds project
     (http://low.sourceforge.net/)
   - Telemachos (http://www.peroxide.dk/), infos about weapon animation and
     miscellaneous bits about uw.

   I also like to thank Telemachos who pointed me to the TSSHP's file formats
   file at the start of all of this.

2  Overview

   This chapter gives a short overview over the game itself, as well as a
   detailed summary about all game files used in Ultima Underworld 1 and 2.


2.1  Remarks

   The game was released in the year 1992, just before Wolfenstein 3D came
   out.was released. So it was the first true first-person game on the PC.

   Ultima Underworld is a MS-DOS based game created in C with Turbo C++ 2.1
   and Optasm as the assembler used (as far as we know). 3d models were done
   with 3d studio max and converted and placed into the executable.

   Ultima Underworld is a trademark of Origin, Inc.


2.2  Document conventions

   This document follows some conventions, to keep a nice and well-to-read
   format. The document is indented by 3 spaces; text must be wrapped at
   line column 79 and tables can (but doesn't need to be) indented with 3
   spaces, too. No tab spaces should be used. Special parts of the formats
   specification that only refer to either Ultima Underworld 1 or 2 are marked
   with [uw1] or [uw2].

   All integer data values in the documentation are referred as Int8 for 8-bit
   values, Int16 and Int32 for 16-bit and 32-bit values. All values are
   unsigned unless noted otherwise. As the game was written and run on x86 PC
   machines, all variables are stored in little-endian format, where e.g. the
   lower byte of a 16-bit value is stored first, then the higher byte. All
   data structures found so far use this scheme.

3  Graphics and visuals

   This chapter explains all visual formats used, e.g. wall/floor/ceiling
   textures, user interface images or animations.


3.1  Palettes

   Ultima Underworld uses several palettes for different purposes. There are
   palettes with 256 indices, as well as auxiliary meta-palettes that have
   16 or 32 entries that map indices to the 256-index palette. As the original
   games directly load the palettes into the VGA registers, effects as color
   flashes done with palette rotating are possible.


3.1.1  256 color palettes

   In the file "pals.dat" there are stored 8 different palettes in UW1 and
   11 in UW2. A palette has the following layout:

   0000  Int8  red   intensity, index 0, range [0..63]
   0001  Int8  green intensity, index 0, range [0..63]
   0002  Int8  blue  intensity, index 0, range [0..63]

   0003  Int8  red   intensity, index 1, range [0..63]
   0004  Int8  green intensity, index 1, range [0..63]
   ...
   02fe  Int8  green intensity, index 255, range [0..63]
   02ff  Int8  blue  intensity, index 255, range [0..63]

   In each palette there are stored color intensities for 256 colors. All
   palettes are stored sequentially in the file.

   Palette index 0 always means transparent color.


3.1.2  16 color auxiliary palette mappings

   In "allpals.dat" there are several auxiliary palettes, used for 4-bit
   images. All indices use palette #0.

   0000  Int8  index to first color
   0001  Int8  index to second color
   ...
   000f  Int8  index to 16th color

   There are 16 values that are indices for palette #0. They build a 16 color
   palette from selected colors of the palette #0.

   In the file "allpals.dat" there are stored 0x1f (=31) such palettes.

   The critter animations (explained in chapter 3.6) use 32 color auxiliary
   palette mappings. They are stored within the animation files.


3.1.3 Palette mappings

   Palette mappings for different light/darkness levels are stored in the
   file "light.dat". The file consists of 16 blocks of palette mappings. Each
   block contains 256 Int8 values which map colors to their palette indices in
   the game palette. The first block is the mapping for original colors, and
   the last one is for "almost black".

   The file "mono.dat" contains palette mappings that maps colors to grayscale
   values. It has the same format as the "light.dat" file and can be
   interchanged to get a gray underworld look. It is used for the spell
   "invisibility".


3.1.4  Palette rotation animations

   In several places of the game the palette is used to create animated
   effects, such as the lava and water textures. Here are the palette indices
   that have to be rotated to produce the animations:

   - Palette #0: in game graphics

    indices 16 through 23: lava fire effect
    indices 48 through 51: water effect

   - Palette #2: game start screen

    indices 64 through 127: "Ultima Underworld" logo warping effect


3.2  Images

   Graphics are stored in "*.gr" files and can be stored with 8-bit or 4-bit
   indices.

   0000  Int8   Graphic file format:
                01 .gr
                02 .tr
                03 .cr [uw2]
                04 .sr [uw2]
                05 .ar [uw2]
   0001  Int16  number of bitmaps
   0003  Int32  offset to bitmap #0
   0007  Int32  offset to bitmap #1
   ...

   Each bitmap has its own header:

   0000  Int8   bitmap type:
                04: 8-bit uncompressed
                08: 4-bit run-length
                0A: 4-bit uncompressed
   0001  Int8   width
   0002  Int8   height

   For the 4-bit formats, there follows another Int8 that selects the
   auxiliary palette to use (see 2.1).

   000n  Int16  size of data for the bitmap.
                in 4-bit formats, this is the number of 4-bit nibbles, not
                bytes.

   The file "panels.gr" contains bitmaps that don't have a bitmap header, but
   immediately starts with image data. The bitmaps are of type 04 and have
   a width of 83 and a height of 114 pixels for UW1 and a width of 79 and
   height of 112 for UW2.


3.2.1  Uncompressed bitmaps (04: 8-bit, 0A: 4-bit)

   All palette indices are stored sequentially, first one line, then the
   next, and so on. For the 4-bit format, first take the upper nibble, then
   the lower nibble.


3.2.2  Compressed bitmaps (type 08, type 06)

   Compressed bitmaps are stored with a run length length encoding and a
   lookup table. The wordsize used for a certain bitmap is determined by the
   type.

      type 08: wordsize 04 bits
      type 06: wordsize 05 bits

   If the size of the compressed image is given in words, the number of bytes
   are calculated as

      bytecount = (wordcount * wordssize + 7) / 8

   The bytes of the compressed image are treated as a bit stream, starting
   at the most significant bit of byte 0.

   Data consists of repeat and run records.
       - Repeat records let the decoder repeat a single word a certain number
         of times.
       - Run record takes a certain number of next nibbles to be as
         uncompressed.

   The decompression engine keeps a counter of the number of repeat records
   that precede the next run record. This counter is initially 1. See
   special count interpretation for repeat records below.

   For every record, first there is a count to retrieve. A count is a single
   number made up from a variable number of words. The alorithm to determine
   a count is as follows:
   Get a word.

      c = w0

   If it is not 0, it is a count. Otherwise, get two more words,
   w1 and w2. The count is:

      c = (w1 << 4) | n2

   If the count is still zero, take another three words, and calculate the
   count:

      c = (((w3 << 4) | w4) << 4) | w5

   Note that even if the wordsize is 5, the words are only shifted by 4 bits,
   thus overlapping the words theoretically. In practice a count is at most 6
   words long, leading to the following possible patterns:

      1 word count : [w0]                          , with (w0) != 0
      2 word count :   0  [w1] [w2]                , with (w1 << 4 | w2) != 0
      3 word count :   0    0    0  [w3] [w4] [w5]

   A run record consists of a count and then follow 'count' words, that are
   the raw pixel data. A repeat record consists of a count and a single word,
   the nibble is then repeated 'count' times.

   As there is no point in repeating a nibble <3 times, there are some
   special meanings for count:
   1: skip this record, the next one is a run record again. may be used at
      the beginning of a file, when it should start with a run rather than
      a repeat.
   2: multiple repeats. get another count, and process 'count' times a
      repeat record.

   Note that there are cases where the decompression yields a greater number
   of words than would be neccessary to display the image.

   The resulting words make up the atom map for a given image. This atom map
   is then translated, byte by byte, from their value range of 16 (4 bit) or
   32 (5 bit) to full 8 bit using the corresponding atom to fragment maps.
   These maps are also sometimes refered to a auxiliary palettes in this
   document.

3.3  Bitmaps

   Bitmaps in Ultima Underworld 1 are stored in "*.byt" files. They just are
   320x200 bitmaps using different palettes. Here's a list of all bitmap
   files:

   blnkmap.byt    blank map bitmap, palette #1
   chargen.byt    character generation bitmap, palette #3
   conv.byt       seems to be a conversation screenshot, palette #0
   main.byt       main game screen bitmap, palette #0
   opscr.byt      opening screen, palette #2
   pres1.byt      "origin presents" screen, palette #5
   pres2.byt      "a blue sky prod. game" screen, palette #5
   win1.byt       winning screen with text, palette #7
   win2.byt       blank winning screen for character info, palette #7

   Ultima Underworld demo contains two separate bitmaps:
   dmain.byt      main demo screen bitmap, palette #0
   presd.byt      "origin and blue sky prod. present..." screen, palette #5

   Underworld 2 has no "*.byt" files. Instead there is one "byt.ark" that
   contains all images. Like every other "*.ark" file this starts with some
   tables followed by the data, in this case the images themselves. There are
   11 entries, of which only 9 are valid:

   entry   palette   usage
    0       1        Map framework - background, crystal, and the like
    1       0        Character generation
    2       0        Bartering
    3                -unused-
    4       0        HUD - the frame, bottles, scroll
    5       0        Underworld 2 Main menu - without menu entries
    6       5        Origin presents
    7       5        Looking Glass Technologies
    8       0        Congratulation screen
    9       0        like the above but without the text
   10                -unused-


3.4  Textures

   Textures are stored in "*.tr" files, where "fXX.tr" files are floor/ceiling
   textures, and "wXX.tr" are wall textures. XX describes the width and height
   resolution of the texture (textures are always square).

   0000  Int8   unknown, always seems to be 2
   0001  Int8   x and y resolution
   0002  Int16  number of textures in file
   0004  Int32  offset to texture #0
   0008  Int32  offset to texture #1
   ...

   The offset of each texture points to the actual texture palette indices,
   which are xyres^2 bytes long. Textures always use palette #0.

   Texture names are stored in string block 10, where wall textures start at
   position 0, and floor textures start at 510, going backwards. The string
   at position 511 is reserved for the ceiling.


3.5  Fonts

   Fonts are stored in "font*.sys" files, and can be non-proportional (chars
   can have different lengths). The header looks as this:

   0000  Int16   unknown, always 1 (might be size of character width field)
   0002  Int16   size of single character, in bytes (=charsize)
   0004  Int16   width of the blank (space) character, in pixels
   0006  Int16   font height in pixels
   0008  Int16   width of a character row in bytes
   000A  Int16   maximum width of a character in pixels (=maxwidth)

   Then follow all bitmaps for each character. The number of chars can be
   determined by (filelen-12) / (charsize+1). Bitmaps are stored as 1-bit
   patterns, starting at the most significant bit in the current byte. When
   a new line in character bitmap begins, remaining bits are unused and a new
   byte in the file is taken.

   After 'charsize' number of bytes, there is another Int8 that says the width
   for the current character in pixels.

   Note: at least the fonts "fontbig.sys" and "font5x6p.sys" contain overly
   large characters, and for these the remaining bits at a line are used. The
   maxwidth field should be corrected for loading.


3.6.1  Critter animations [uw1]

   Critter animations are stored in the folder "crit". The file "assoc.anm"
   holds data for each of the 32 animations and for the 64 NPC types. The file
   starts with 8 bytes for the name of each animation. Shorter strings are
   padded with zeros. Empty strings denote animations not available (e.g. in
   the "uw_demo").

   Next comes a table of infos for each NPC. The table is 64 entries (0x0080)
   long:

   0000   Int8   anim
   0001   Int8   auxpal

   The "anim" field specifies which one of the 32 animations to take for a
   given NPC number (NPC object ID - 0x0040). A value of 0xff indicates that
   no animation is available.

   The "auxpal" value describes which auxiliary palette to use. There are
   several critters that share the same animations but use different palettes,
   e.g. the bat and the vampire bat uses the same anim value, but different
   auxiliary palettes.

   Animation for each critter is stored in a file named "CrXXpage.nYY", where
      XX = animation number (=anim), YY = page number
      XX and YY are octal numbers

   There may be more than one page for each animation file.
   The file starts with a header:

   pos     length          desc.
   0000    Int8            anim slot base
   0001    Int8            number of anim slots (=nslot)
   0002    nslot*Int8      list of segment indices

   After this, a list of segment follows which contains up to 8 frame indices
   for every segment.

   nslot+2 Int8            number of anim segments (=nsegs)
           8*nsegs         anim frame indices

   Then the auxiliary palettes follow:

           Int8            number of aux palettes (=npals)
           npals*32        allaux palette indices in blocks of 32

   Next is a list of all frames and their offsets into the file:

           Int8            number of frame offsets (=noffsets)
           Int8            compression type? (always 06)
           noffsets*Int16  absolute offsets to frame headers

   Each animation is stored in a segment which can contain a number of
   frames (stored in the "animation frame indices"). Each list is padded with
   0xFF entries.

   frame header

   0000    Int8       width
   0001    Int8       height
   0002    Int8       hotspot x
   0003    Int8       hotspot y
   0004    Int8       compression type; (06: 5-bit word size)
   0005    Int16      data length in number of words
   0007               start of rle-encoded image data (see 2.3)

   The hotspot coordinates are to "pin" the image at a specific position. The
   hotspot coordinates in the image should always be on the same place when
   rendered. The compression type can be 06, which is 5-bit run-length
   encoding, or 08, which is 4-bit run-length encoding (see 2.3. for more).

   The slot lists group together segments of animations for various actions.
   Here's a list of slots and their actions:

      slot   action
       00    combat idle
       01    attack, bash (?)
       02    attack, slash (?)
       03    attack, thrust
       05    second weapon attack
       07    walking / running towards player
       0c    death
       0d    ??

       20    idle, facing away from player (180 degrees)
       21    idle, 135 deg.
       22    idle, angle 90 deg.
       23    idle, angle 45 deg.
       24    idle, facing towards player, 0 deg.
       25    idle, angle -45 deg.
       26    idle, angle -90 deg.
       27    idle, angle -135 deg.

   Segment indices at 80-87 are the same as above, except that these are the
   walking animations. For the animations used in the Ethereal Void (level 9)
   the slot list is somewhat different.

   Here is a list of animation files and their contents:

      file   assoc name   auxpals   used in
      cr00 * "gngob32"    4         green goblin

   The animations marked with * are available in the uw_demo, too.

3.6.2  Critter animations [uw2]

   The following files of the CRIT folder are involved in Underworld 2
   animations:

   PG.MP :   contains a skiptable to find a frame in the CRxx.yy files
   CR.AN :   animation sequences for all critter and all actions
   AS.AN :   contains a mapping of critter IDs to CRxx.yy files and palettes
   CRxx.yy : the pixel information for critter xx, fragment yy



3.6.2.1 Format and use of CR.AN

   This file contains 32 chunks [C] of 512 bytes each.
   Each chunk contains the complete animation information for one character.

      x*512 : start character x animation definition [C]

   Each chunk has 8 subchunks of 64 bytes. A subchunk [SC] describes the
   animation frames to take for a certain action. The actions are

      [C]+0000 : [SC] standing
      [C]+0040 : [SC] walking
      [C]+0080 : [SC] in combat
      [C]+00c0 : [SC] attack
      [C]+0100 : [SC] attack
      [C]+0140 : [SC] attack
      [C]+0180 : [SC] attack
      [C]+01c0 : [SC] dying

   The use of the attack animations differs from critter to critter since not
   all critters have 4 different attacks. If a critter has magical and melee
   attacks, the melee attacks come first.

   Each action is split into 8 animation sequence [AS] definitions for the
   angle it is observed from. The blocks always contain valid values, even if
   there is no explicit frame for a certain animation e.g dying usually exists
   only from a frontal point of view, thus the animation for all angles is the
   same.

      [SC]+0000 : [AS] rear
      [SC]+0008 : [AS] rear    right
      [SC]+0010 : [AS]         right
      [SC]+0018 : [AS] front   right
      [SC]+0020 : [AS] front
      [SC]+0028 : [AS] front   left
      [SC]+0030 : [AS]         left
      [SC]+0038 : [AS] rear    left

   The layout of each animation sequences is as follows:
   The frame indices reference values in the offset table of CRxx.*
   Use the values in PG.MP to find the right fragment, see 3.6.2.4

      [CB]+0 .. [CB]+6 : animation frame index
      [CB]+7           : number of valid entries starting at [CB]

   Invalid entries in the animation frame indices are marked with 0xFF


3.6.2.2 Format and use of AS.AN

   Multiple critters use the same pixel layout with differing palettes.
   This file contains two int8 for each critterID from 0 to 63. 0xFF
   marks unused indices (the last entry of AS.AN)

      2*n   : [int8] critter file to use (xx of CRxx.*)
      2*n+1 : [int8] atom to fragment map index


3.6.2.3 Format and use of CRxx.yy

   Each unique critter is contained in its own file CRxx. For various reasons
   each critter is split across multiple files. There are 32 critter pixel
   maps. xx in the filename is encoded in octal.

      0000..007F : atom to fragment mapping
      0080..027F : [int16] table of offsets into the file for frame data
      0280..eof  : frame data

   The actual color value to be used for displaying a single pixel is
   determined as follows:
      Decompressing the pixel map for a frame yields an atom map. The size of
         an atom for a critter is 5 bit.
      The atom is converted to a fragment using the atom to fragment map
         determined by the entity id and the index from AS.AN.
      The fragment is converted to a colorindex using the current light level
         and LIGHTS.DAT or MONO.DAT.
      Finally the colorindex is translated to a rgb color by applying PALS.DAT

   All fragments of one critter CRxx.00, CRxx.01, etc have the same
   header describing the pixel mapping from atom to fragment.

      0000..001F : atom to fragment mapping 0
      0020..003F : atom to fragment mapping 1
      0040..005F : atom to fragment mapping 2
      0060..007F : atom to fragment mapping 3

   Mapping 3 is never accessed from AS.AN. The trigger for this mapping is
   unknown.

   The offset table of the first file starts at index 0. The offset table of
   the next fragment continues with the index where the previous left off.
   (see also PG.MP).

      0080+frame*2 : [int16] offset into this for file [O]

   The frame data is defined in the same manner as in Underworld 1.

      [O] + 0000    [Int8]       width
      [O] + 0001    [Int8]       height
      [O] + 0002    [Int8]       hotspot x
      [O] + 0003    [Int8]       hotspot y
      [O] + 0004    [Int8]       compression type; (06: 5-bit word size)
      [O] + 0005    [Int16]      data length in number of words
      [O] + 0007                 start of rle-encoded image data (see 2.3)


3.6.2.4 Format and use of PG.MP

   The purpose of PG.MP is to find the file fragment yy of a specific critter
   xx, given a specific frame. The file contains 32 fragment id chunks. Each
   fragment id chunk has 8 bytes. Each byte corresponds to a fragment and
   contains the last animation frame contained in the fragment. Invalid
   combinations of xx and yy (== CRxx.yy does not exist) are marked with 0xFF.

      8*xx+yy : [int8] last frame in fragment yy (file CRxx.yy)


3.7.1  Cutscene animations [uw1]

   Cutscene animations are stored in folder "cuts". Text strings for cutscenes
   can be found in string blocks 0c00 through 0c21. Chapter 2.2.1 lists all
   animations available in Ultima Underworld 1.

   The cutscene files are done with Amiga's DeluxePaint Animator (file
   extension *.anm). The complete description can be found in the zip file
   "anmformt.zip" in the "misc" folder. Here's a short overview for usage in
   Ultima Underworld 1:

   The files, "large page files", consist of a header, followed by one or
   more large pages, where each page can store one or more animation frames.
   A large page is always 64k big, except for the last page (which is
   truncated at the end of usable data).

   The file starts with a "large page file header":

      0000   Int32   file ID, always contains "LPF "
      ...
      0006   Int16   number of large pages in the file
      0008   Int32   number of records in the file
      ...
      0010   Int32   content type, always contains "ANIM"
      0014   Int16   width in pixels
      0016   Int16   height in pixels

   The whole header is 128 bytes long. After the header color cycling info
   follows (which also is 128 bytes long), which is not used in uw1. Then
   comes the color palette:

      0000   Int8    intensity for blue, ranges from 0..255
      0001   Int8    intensity for green
      0002   Int8    intensity for red
      0003   Int8    padding byte
      ...            repeated for all 256 color indices

   After the palette an array with 256 "large page descriptors" follow:

      0000   Int16   number of first record in the large page
      0002   Int16   number of records in the large page
      0004   Int16   total number of bytes, excluding header

   Unused descriptors contain no information. After the array, the large pages
   start. A "large page" has the following layout:

      0000   lpdesc  large page descriptor
      0006   Int16   empty
      0008   Int16   length of first record
      000A   Int16   length of second record
      ...

   The large page descriptor is repeated for the current large page. A record
   contains a frame (which may depend on the previous frame). The start can be
   calculated by summing up the length of the previous records. A "record" has
   the following structure:

      0000   Int8    unknown
      0001   Int8    flag
      0002   Int16   extra offset, when flag != 0
      0004           start of compressed data

   The extra offset must be even (when odd, add an extra 1).

   The compression scheme is a variation of run-length encoding, with some
   extras. There are "dump", "run" and "skip" records. "dump" records just
   copy the next bytes to the output buffer. "run" records get the next byte
   and repeat them according to the count. A "skip" record skips pixels in the
   output buffer (it is assumed that the previous decoded image is still in
   the buffer).

   First, read a signed Int8. If it is positive, dump that many bytes.
   If it is 0, the next two Int8's are the count and the pixel byte for a
   "run" record. For negative values, remove the sign bit. If the resulting
   byte is != 0, skip that many bytes in the output, else a "long" operation
   is started.

   For the long operation, retrieve the next two Int8's, treating as a little
   endian signed Int16. If the value is 0, the decoding ends. If the value
   is > 0, skip that many bytes in the output. For values < 0, remove the sign
   bit. If the resulting value is >= 0x4000, we have a "run" record with
   count = value & 0x3fff and the next Int8 as the pixel index. If the value
   is <= 0x4000, we have a long "dump" record.

   Here is some meta-C code to describe the decoding:

      while(true)
      {
         Int8 cnt = get_next_src8();

         if (cnt>0) dump_pixels(cnt);
         if (cnt==0) run_pixels(get_next_src8(),get_next_src8());
         if (cnt<0)
         {
            cnt &= 0x7f;
            if (cnt!=0) skip_pixels(cnt);
            else
            {
               // we have a "long" operation
               Int8 cnt2 = get_next_src16();
               if (cnt2>0)
                  skip_pixels(cnt2);
               else
               if (cnt2==0)
                  break;
               else
               {
                  cnt2 &= 0x7fff;

                  if (cnt2>=0x4000)
                     run_pixels(cnt2-0x4000,get_next_src());
                  else
                     dump_pixels(cnt2);
               }
            }
         }
      }

3.7.2  Cutscene animation [uw2]

   Cutscenes in underworld 2 are stored in the CUTS/ folder. Each cutscene is
   split into a header file and one or more fragment files. Files starting
   with CSxxx are part of cutscene x with the number encoded in octal in the
   filename. The extension of the the file is .N00 for the header and .Nyy for
   fragment y, again encoded in octal.
   The cutscenes can refer to background files LBACKxxx.BYT

3.7.2.1 Cutscene header format [uw2]

   The cutscene header for each cutscene is stored in file CSxxx.N00. The
   format of the file is yet unknown. The file is supposed to hold
      the music to play during playback
      the sound effect (voice over) to play
      which subtitles to use
      references to LBACKxxx and paning information

3.7.2.2 Cutscene fragment format [uw2]

   A cutscene fragment is stored largely in the same manner as in uw1: The file
   contains one record for each frame in the animation. Records are stored in
   pages, where each page can contain a variable number of records.
   Each fragment is associated with a single string of a block in STRINGS.PAK
   Relevant fields are

   00000006 - 00000007      number of pages in the the fragment
   00000008 - 0000000B      number of records (=frames) in the fragment
   00000044 - 00000045      framerate
   00000080 - 000000FF      palette cycling information
   00000100 - 000004FF      initial palette information 256 x[blue green red 0]
   00000500 - ........      short page header
   00000B00 - 00010AFF		page 0
   00010B00 - 00020AFF      page 1
   ....

   <<TODO framerate>>
   <<TODO palette cycling>>
   <<TODO document page header>>
   <<TODO document record layout>>


3.7.2.2 Cutscene background format [uw2]

   Cutscene backgrounds are simple index maps of 320 x 200 pixel. The pixel
   are orderes top to bottom and left to right. The palette is stored with
   the cutscene that references the background.

3.8  Weapon animations

   Attack animations:
   ------------------
   The file weapons.gr contains animation frames for attacks with the various
   weapon types.

   The file contains 224 image frames, split into 112 for right-handed attacks
   and 112 for left handed.

   For each weapon, including the fist, 3 animations are stored: slash, stab
   and hack - even if identical. After these three animations one "ready"
   frame is stored.

   Each animation has 4 "power-up" frames and 5 "attack frames", some of which
   can be black (a small 2x2 image)
   Therefore, each weapon type has 3*9+1 = 28 frames, 4 attack types gives 112
   images.

   TODO: mace seems not to fit this exactly!!!

   Weapons.dat:
   ------------
   This file stores 8-bit coordinates for the frames of the various attack
   animations. For each attack type first 28 x-coordinates are stored, then
   28 y-coordinates. There are 8 such sets of coordinates:

   right hand sword
   right hand axe
   right hand mace
   right hand fist
   left  hand sword
   left  hand axe
   left  hand mace
   left  hand fist

   Coordinates pin-point the upper-left corner of the attack frame and are
   relative to the lower left corner of the 3d-view area.

   Weapons.cm:
   -----------
   This file stores two aux 16-color pallettes for the attack animation
   frames. These are needed to tint the weapon attack frames according to the
   skin color of the selected character. I haven't checked, but probably one
   of these match the "standard" aux pallette used for the .gr files...


3.9   XFER.DAT Transparencies

   The following was observed in uw2 but should be valid for uw1 as well.
   The file XFER.DAT contains 5 color shifting palettes to provide for
   transparencies. Certain colors in critter color index tables do not
   overwrite the underlying pixel. Instead they trigger a lookup into
   XFER.DAT. Colorindices are

      0xf0   fade to red
      0xf4   fade to blue
      0xf8   fade to green
      ????   fade to white
      ????   fade to black
   <<TODO confirm / complete>>

   XFER.DAT layout

      0x0080      fade to red
      0x0100      fade to green
      0x0180      fade to blue
      0x0200      fade to white
      0x0280      fade to black

   XFER.DAT usage

      The pixel that would overwrite the existing pixel decides which fade
      block to choose from. The pixel that would be overwritten decides the
      index inside the the fade block. The value at that location replaces
      the original.

   XFER.DAT for modern systems

      When trying to recreate a the same effect on modern systems which are not
      palette based, one can either create a pixelshader which does the same
      translation XFER.DAT did for colorindices in RGB or derive the parameters
      for the more common transparency equation

         dst_color = overlay_color * alpha + (1-alpha) * src_color

      One way to do this is look for colorindeces that are mapped on
      themselves by XFER.DAT. These pixel, which are essentially unaffected by
      XFER.DAT have roughly the same color as the overlay and can subsequently
      be used to derive an average alpha value for the texture.

4  Level maps and object lists

   Level map information is stored in the file "lev.ark". A default map is
   in the "data" folder and is loaded after character creation. During
   gameplay, the map is stored in the folder "Save0".


4.1  File format

   The file is a container for several differently-sized blocks that contain
   different infos of the level maps. Some blocks may be unused, e.g. automap
   blocks.

   The file header looks like this:

   0000   Int16   number of blocks in file
   0002   Int32   file offset to block 0
   0006   Int32   file offset to block 1
   ...            etc.

   File offsets are absolute offsets into the file. When an offset is 0, the
   block is not available.

   Ultima Underworld 1 has 135 (0x0087) entries (9 levels x 15 blocks). The
   block layout is as following:

   <9 blocks level tilemap/master object list>
   <9 blocks object animation overlay info>
   <9 blocks texture mapping>
   <9 blocks automap infos>
   <9 blocks map notes>

   The remaining 9 x 10 blocks are unused.

   The Ultima Underworld Demo uses three separate files to store the map.
   Here's a list of the files and what blocks they contain:

   level13.st    level tilemap/master object list block
   level13.txm   texture mapping
   level13.anx   object animation overlay info

   Ultima Underworld 2 has 320 (0x0140) entries (80 levels x 4 blocks). These
   can be split into 4 sets of 80 entries each:

       0.. 79  level maps
      80..159  texture mappings
     160..239  automap infos
     240..319  map notes

   [uw2] Data blocks for Ultima Underworld 2 are compressed using the uw2
   compression scheme described in chapter 9.1.

   The "level tilemap/master object list" for each level contains infos about
   the level architecture (tilemap) and the objects which live in it:

   offset  size   description
   0000    4000   tilemap (64 x 64 x 4 bytes)
   4000    1b00   mobile object information (objects 0000-00ff, 256 x 27 bytes)
   5b00    1800   static object information (objects 0100-03ff, 768 x 8 bytes)
   7300    01fc   free list for mobile objects (objects 0002-00ff, 254 x 2 bytes)
   74fc    0600   free list for static objects (objects 0100-03ff, 768 x 2 bytes)
   7afc    0104   unknown (260 bytes)
   7c00    0002
   7c02    0002   no. entries in mobile free list minus 1
   7c04    0002   no. entries in static free list minus 1
   7c06    0002   0x7775 ('uw')


4.2  Level tilemap

   Each underworld level consists of a 64x64 tile map (just like on a chess
   board). A tile can be of different types and can have various floor
   heights. The ceiling height is fixed. A tile can have an index
   into the master object list that is the start of an object chain with
   objects in this tile.

   The first 0x4000 bytes of each "level tilemap/master object list" contain
   the tilemap info bytes. For each tile there are two Int16 that describe a
   tile's properties. The map's origin is at the lower left tile, going to the
   right, each line in turn.

   The two Int16 values can be split into bits:

   0000 tile properties / flags:

      bits     len  description
       0- 3    4    tile type (0-9, see below)
       4- 7    4    floor height
       8       1    unknown (?? special light feature ??) always 0 in uw1
       9       1    0, never used in uw1
      10-13    4    floor texture index (into texture mapping)
      14       1    when set, no magic is allowed to cast/to be casted upon
      15       1    door bit (when 1, a door is present)

   0002 tile properties 2 / object list link

      bits     len  description
       0- 5    6    wall texture index (into texture mapping)
       6-15    10   first object in tile (index into master object list)

   about word 0000, bit 8:
      For UW2 Bit 8 is set pretty often, and if set the light level changes.
      Ironically 1 sometimes means daylight (in Lord British Castle Lv 1) but
      sometimes 0 means daylight (LBC Lv 5). But the areas are exactly right.

   about the floor height (word 0000, bits 4-7):
      UW internally uses 7 bits for the map height (0..127). The full range of
      7 bits is stored in the object properties, but only 4 bits are stored in
      in the tilemap, so this value should be left shifted by 3 bits.

   Underworld tile types are:
    00      Solid (wall tile)
    01      Open (square tile of empty space)
    02      Diagonal, open SE
    03      Diagonal, open SW
    04      Diagonal, open NE
    05      Diagonal, open NW
    06      Sloping up to the north
    07      Sloping up to the south
    08      Sloping up to the east
    09      Sloping up to the west


4.2  Master object list

   The master object list is stored after the tilemap data. There are 1024
   (0x0400) list positions. The first 256 are reserved for "mobile objects"
   that have extra NPC info. The rest of the list is used for "static
   objects". The list entries are allocated from the end to the beginning of
   the lists. Item positions that are free are stored in the "free lists",
   described in chapter 4.3.

   Entry 0 is never allocated and is used to test against item links of value
   0. Entry 1 is partly used to store the player's informations, e.g.
   direction or in-tile x/y positions.

   Each object entry has a "general object info" block consisting of 4 Int16
   words. The 256 "mobile objects" are followed by 19 bytes "mobile object
   extra info", resulting in entries of 27 bytes length. The remaining 768
   entries only have 8 bytes each. The "mobile object extra info" is described
   in chapter 4.2.3.

   The "general object info" block looks as following:

        bits  size  field      description

   0000 objid / flags
        0- 8   9   "item_id"   Object ID (see below)
        9-12   4   "flags"     Flags
          12   1   "enchant"   Enchantment flag (enchantable objects only)
          13   1   "doordir"   Direction flag (doors)
          14  1   "invis"     Invisible flag (don't draw this object)
          15   1   "is_quant"  Quantity flag (link field is quantity/special)
        OR
        9-15       texture number

        Note: some objects don't have flags and use the whole lower byte as a
        texture number (gravestone, picture, lever, switch, shelf, bridge, ..)

   0002 position
        0- 6   7   "zpos"      Object Z position (0-127)
        7- 9   3   "heading"   Heading (*45 deg)
       10-12   3   "ypos"      Object Y position (0-7)
       13-15   3   "xpos"      Object X position (0-7)

   0004 quality / chain
        0- 5   6   "quality"   Quality
        6-15   10  "next"      Index of next object in chain

   0006 link / special
        0- 5   6   "owner"     Owner / special
        6-15   10  (*)         Quantity / special link / special property

   All field names listed are used later to refer to these fields in the
   object's information words.

   Object IDs can be split up for classification purposes. Read more in
   chapter 6 about it.

   Objects in a tile are stored as a linked list, where the "Index of next
   object in chain" points to the next object in list, or contains 0 for the
   end of the linked list. The first object in the list is determined by the
   tile's object index value (see above, at "Tile map").

   (*) The "Quantity" field in word 0006 can have several meanings. If the
   "is_quant" field is 0 (unset), it contains the index of an associated
   object. The exact meaning varies, but is generally a "has-a" type
   relationship (contents, trap to set off, spell). The field name "sp_link"
   is used in this document if that type of field is meant.

   If the "is_quant" flag is set, the field is a quantity or a special
   property. If the value is < 512 or 0x0200 it gives the number of stacked
   items present. Identical objects may be stacked up to 256 objects at a
   time. The field name "quantity" is used for this.

   If the value is > 512, the value minus 512 is a special property; the
   object type defines the further meaning of this value (see chapter 6.1 for
   all special objects in Ultima Underworld). The field name "property" is
   used for this type of value.

   Note that the term "object" and "item" are used concurrently in the
   document and always mean the same thing.


4.2.1  Enchantments

   If the enchantment flag is set and the object is enchantable, then the
   link field (less 512) determines the enchantment. Enchantment names are
   stored in strings chunk 5. The way in which the link value maps onto
   spells in this chunk depends on the object type.

   Most objects seem to use spells 256-320 (add 256) if the enchantment
   number is in the range 0-63, otherwise they add 144 to use spells 208 and
   up. Healing fountains, however, don't use a correction at all.

   Weapons and armour have a more complex mapping. Most enchanted weapons and
   pieces of armour have an enhancement for Accuracy, Damage, Protection or
   Toughness, which are spells 448-479 in the main spell list. These map to
   special property values 192-207. Yes, there are only 16 values for 32
   spells; enchanted armour adds another 16 to the spell index to bring it
   into the armour enchantment range. However, these items may also carry
   generic enchantments, in which case the special properties map to spells
   0-255 (and armour doesn't apply a special correction).

   Wands don't hold their enchantments directly in the quantity field, since
   they also need to store the number of charges remaining. Instead, they
   link to a spell object which holds the enchantment; it seems here that
   the "quality" field of the spell object determines the number of charges.
   Other objects may also carry spells in this way.


4.2.2  Item Owner

   Some items have a "... belongs to <critter type>" description. The common
   object properties (see chapter 6.2) determine if an object can have an
   owner. The string printed is stored in the "owner" field and is an index
   into string block 1; the string printed for the critter type is
   "owner" - 1 + 370. When the field is 0, the object doesn't belong to anyone.


4.2.3  Mobile object extra info

   The values stored in the NPC info area (19 bytes) contain infos for
   critters unique to each object.

   offsets     type     bits   meaning

   0008   0000   Int8   0-7    npc_hp
   0009   0001
   000a   0002   Int8   7
   000b   0003   Int16  0-3    npc_goal
                        4-11   npc_gtarg
   000d   0005   Int16  0-3    npc_level
                        4-11
                        8
                        13     npc_talkedto
                        14-15  npc_attitude
   000f   0007   Int16  6- 12  npc height?
   0011   0009
   0012   000a
   0013   000b   Int8   7      single bit, unknown
   0014   000c
   0015   000d
   0016   000e   Int16  0-3    unknown
                        4-9    npc_yhome
                        10-15  npc_xhome
   0018   0010   Int8   0-4:   npc_heading?
                        5-7:
   0019   0011   Int8   0-6:   npc_hunger (?)
   001a   0012   Int8          npc_whoami

   The values are used for combat, AI and conversations.


4.3  Free lists

   The free lists generally contain infos about the master object list usage
   and are used for object slot allocation/deallocation.

   Free list, mobile objects
   -------------------------
   This consists of an Int16 for each mobile object (critter) slot which is
   not in use, giving the slot position in the master object list. Note that
   there are only 254 entries in this table because object 0 is always the
   null object (and hence is never allocated) and object 1 is always the
   avatar (and can never be free - that's probably a metaphor for life, or
   something). Of course, only the first (no. free mobile objects) entries
   are valid.

   Free list, static objects
   -------------------------
   This consists of an Int16 for each static object which is not in use, as
   above. This table is 768 entries long (room for all possible static objects).


4.4  Texture mappings

   The texture mapping table are used to map tile texture indices to the
   actual texture used, since wall and floor textures are only encoded with
   6 and 4 bits. The block of size 0x007a always look like this:

   0000  48 x Int16   wall texture number (from w64.tr)
   0060  10 x Int16   floor texture number (from f32.tr)
   0074  6 x Int8     door texture number (from doors.gr)
   007a

   The last value from the floor texture number array is used as ceiling
   texture.

   "Look" descriptions come from block 000a, where wall textures use strings 0
   to 255 and floor textures are described by strings 256 to 510, in reverse
   order. Ceiling always uses string 511.

   In uw2 the texture mapping is 134 (0x0086) bytes long and contains 64
   Int16 entries that are indices into t64.tr. The first 16 entries are shared
   by the floor and wall indices. Entries above 16 are wall-only textures.
   Ceiling seems to be textured by entry 0x20. The last 6 bytes is the door
   texture mapping, see above.

   "Look" descriptions are almost the same as in uw1, but as textures can be
   shared between walls and floors, there are two descriptions for every entry
   in t64.tr. Floor descriptions start at string 255 without reversing order.


4.5  Animation infos

   This block contains entries with length of 6 bytes with infos about
   objects with animation overlay images from "animo.gr".
   It always is 0x0180 bytes long which leads to 64 entries.

   0000   Int16   link1
   0002   Int16   unk2
   0004   Int8    tile x coordinate
   0005   Int8    tile y coordinate

   link1's most significant 10 bits contain a link into the master object
   list, to the object that should get an animation overlay.


4.6  Automap infos

   Each block contains the "visited" bytes for each level. Each byte
   describes a tile on the main map. The block size always is 0x1000.

   The following was observed in Underworld 2.
   The automap contains one byte per tile, in the same order as the
   level tilemap. A valid value in the low nybble means the tile is displayed
   on the map. Valid values are the same as tile types:
            SOLID    0x0
            CLEAR    0x1
      Diagonal Tiles have a flat floor and are divided diagonally,
      the direction of the wall normals is given as suffix to 'DIAG_'
            DIAG_SE  0x2
            DIAG_SW  0x3
            DIAG_NE  0x4
            DIAG_NW  0x5
      Slope Tiles are treated like ordinary CLEAR tiles
            SLOPE_N  0x6
            SLOPE_S  0x7
            SLOPE_E  0x8
            SLOPE_W  0x9
   Other values are considered undiscovered

   The high nybble contains a modifier on how to display the tile:
            DEFAULT  0x0
            DOOR     0x1
            TELEPORT 0x3
            WATER    0x4
            BRIDGE   0x6
            LAVA     0xc

4.7  Map notes

   The following was observed in Underworld 2.
   The map labels are compressed with the same scheme as the tiles. Each
   label is stored in 54 (0x36)bytes, regardless of the actual length of the note.

   The number of labels has to be calculated by dividing the size of the
   uncompressed chunk by 54. Each label has the following format:

      0000 - 0031  zero-terminated string
      0032  int16  x-position
      0034  int16  y-position

   Like the tile map the y-position is inverted with 0 denoting the bottom
   of the screen and 200 (0xc8) the top of the screen.


4.8  Terrain texture properties

   The file "terrain.dat" in the data directory contains information on the
   terrain types represented by the various wall and floor textures. There is
   a 16-bit word per texture, up to a maximum of 256 walls and 256 floors.
   Floor data therefore starts at file offset 0x200. Terrain types are:

    0000    Normal (solid) wall or floor
    0002    Ankh mural (shrines)
    0003    Stairs up
    0004    Stairs down
    0005    Pipe
    0006    Grating
    0007    Drain
    0008    Chained-up princess
    0009    Window
    000a    Tapestry
    000b    Textured door (used for the lock to the Key of Infinity)
    0010    Water (not waterfall)
    0020    Lava (not lavafall)
    0040    Waterfall      - UW2
    00C0    Ice wall       - UW2
    00D8
    00E8    Ice walls (crumbling?)
    0080    Lavafall       - UW2
    00F8    Ice            - UW2


 +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


5  String resources

   Game strings are stored in the file "strings.pak", and uses a Huffman
   compression scheme to store its strings. The first 2 bytes of the file give
   the number of nodes in the tree. Then follow the nodes themselves, 4 bytes
   each:

   0000   Int8   char symbol
   0001   Int8   parent node
   0002   Int8   left child
   0003   Int8   right child

   The last node stored in the file is the head of the tree. Following the
   nodes is a 16-bit word giving the number of string blocks in the
   file. Then follows the block directory, 6 bytes per block as follows:

   0000   Int16   block number
   0002   Int32   offset in file of start of block

   Each block contains a variable number of strings. The block header is:

   0000   Int16   no. of strings
   0002   Int16   relative offset from end of block header to first string
   0004   Int16   relative offset to second string
   ...

   Strings are compressed using the Huffman tree in the usual way. Bits are
   extracted big-endian i.e. rotated out of the top of each byte in turn.
   Starting with the root node (last node), if a 1 bit is encountered the right
   branch is taken, otherwise take the left. Repeat until a leaf (node with -1
   for its children) is reached, at which point output the symbol for that node.
   For the next bit we start again from the root. End of string is marked with a
   `|' character. The remaining bits in the last byte are unused.


5.1  String block contents [uw1]

   block   description
   0001    general UI strings
   0002    character creation strings, mantras (?)
   0003    wall text/scroll/book/book title strings (*)
   0004    object descriptions (*)
   0005    object "look" descriptions, object quality states
   0006    spell names
   0007    conversation partner names, starting at string 17 for conv 1
   0008    text on walls, signs
   0009    text trap messages
   000a    wall/floor description text
   0018    debugging strings (not used ingame)
   0c00    intro cutscene text
   0c01    ending cutscene text
   0c02    tyball cutscene text
   0c03    arial cuscene text (?)
   0c18    dream cutscene 1 text "arrived"
   0c19    dream cutscene 2 text "talismans"
   0c1a-0c21  garamon cutscene texts
   0e01-0f3a  conversation strings

   Block 0003 contains text/scroll etc. strings. The exact string to use for
   books, scrolls or other text object is in the quantity field. It is
   calculated as quantity - 0x0200. For each level, 32 string slots are available.

   Block 0004 contains the object descriptions. The article (e.g. 'a' or
   'an') is separated with an underscore '_'. When a '&' is in the string,
   it separates the plural of the object's name. The complete text string is
   "you see <article> <mood> <description> [named <npc-name>]. <mood> can be
   one of "mellow" or "upset".

   In the uw_demo, the 0cXX blocks and many of the conversation string
   blocks aren't available.

5.2  String block contents [uw2]

   The layout of strings.pak has not changed from uw1 to uw2. Common
   strings are followed by cutscenes and conversations. As before not every
   ID has been used. Block 3 (ID 0004) contains strings with special markup
   characters. The underscore '_' is replaced by the according item condition
   string taken from block 4 (ID 0005). An ampersand '&' marks strings with
   different singular/plural forms. A plural form never contains a condition.

   index      ID    size
       0    0001     512    technical stuff, number text conversion
       1    0002     512    character generation
       2    0003     512    books, scrolls. readable items
       3    0004     512    item names
       4    0005     512    item condition
       5    0006     512    light levels, spell friendly names, spell effects
       6    0007     512    barter quality, npc names, monster internal names
       7    0008     512    wall labels, tombs. readable stuff in the world
       8    0009     512    game state messages: vision, door state
       9    000a     512    descriptions of textures/decals
      10    0018     512    debug/console strings

   Cutscenes include the intro and outro as well as the various taunts by
   the guardian which occur during conversations or dreams.

   index      ID    size
      11    0c00      13
      ..      ..      ..
      28    0c2b       1

   Conversation strings used by the conversation engine. Contains both the
   phrases by the npc the player is talking to, as well as the answers by the
   player. The npc name for each conversation is stored in block 6 (ID 0007).
   The name of the npc for a given conversation is (ID - 0x0e00 + 16), e.g.
   ID 0x0e2e contains the conversation with character 0x3e (62), Jerry the Rat

   A description string for each object is stored in game strings block 0004

   Object IDs are in the range 0x0000 to 0x01ff. The bits can be split up
   for classification purposes of different objects:

      bits
      0..3  object number in subclass
      4..5  object subclass
      6..8  object class

   The object class groups together 0x0040 (64) items each. Here's a list
   of some classes:

   class  item_id  description
    1     0040     npc's
    6     0180     traps/triggers
                   subclass 0/1: traps
                   subclass 2: triggers
    7     01c0     sprites, animated objects


6.1  List of all objects and items

   This chapter lists and describes all objects that are available in Ultima
   Underworld. Descriptions for obvious items are omitted.

   000f  a_fist
         this is not really an item, but is used for fist combat

   002f  a_pair of dragon skin boots
         player doesn't get hurt when walking on lava

   0040..0x007e  NPC's
         "sp_link" points to the inventory start

   007f  an_adventurer
         the player as object; isn't used ingame

   008f  a_rune bag
         looking at the bag shows the rune bag panel; available runes are
         stored in the savegame

   0098  a_wand (and other wands)
         "sp_link" points to a_spell object

   00c6  a_pile of bones
         the "owner" field determines from whom the bones are; strings are
         taken from block 4; a value of 63 means "an adventurer"

   0100  a_key (and up to 010e)
         the key ID that is needed to unlock a door with an associated lock
         object is stored in the "owner" field.

   010f  a_lock
         the lock object is associated with a door or portcullis and
         determines the lock state and the lock ID. bit 9 of the flags
         indicates if the lock is locked (1) or unlocked (0). the lower 6 bits
         of the "link/special" field determines the lock ID. when unlocking a
         door with a key, the lock ID must match the key ID on the key.

   0110  a_picture of Tom

   0114  a_book
         the book explodes when the user tries to look at it; player takes
         damage.

   0120  a_spell
         spell object used by wands, spell traps, magical items;
         the "quality" field

   013b  a_map
         the map is shown when looked at the map in inventory. The string at
         block 1, string 151 is printed, too.

   0140  a_door (and up to 014f)
         if bit 1 of the "owner" field is set, the door is spiked. if the
         "sp_link" field points to a_lock object, the door is locked.
         0146 is a portcullis and 0147 is a secret door. doors from 0148
         to 014f are the open versions of the closed doors.
         the textures for the doors come from the 6 bytes at the end of the
         texture mapping info from lev.ark.
         the "doordir" bit determines in which direction the door swings open.
         Doors are rendered using two 3d models, one for the frame and one for
         the door. It appears that the frame uses the wall texture of the tile
         in which the door is located. The frame also seems to change the color
         of the "border" between the two sides according to the object.

   0150  a_bench
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   0154  a_large boulder
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   0157  a_shrine
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   0158  a_table
         3d object (see section about 3d models). Texture is 32 from tmobj.gr.

   015a  a_moongate
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   015c  a_barrel
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   015c  a_chair
         3d object (see section about 3d models). Texture is 38 from tmobj.gr.

   015d  a_chest
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   015e  a_nightstand
         3d object (see section about 3d models)

   0160  a_pillar
         3d object. texture is determined by the lower byte of the "flags"
         field from "tmobj.gr"

   0161  a_lever
         3d object. A clock-like lever with 8 positions; texture is determined
         by the "flags" field (lower 3 bits) + 4, from "tmobj.gr".

   0162  a_switch
         3d object. Almost the same as 0161, but starting with image 12 of
         "tmobj.gr". Not used in uw1

   0163  a_picture [uw2]
         3d object. Texture is lower byte of flags + 42 from "tmobj.gr"

         ??? [uw1]
         uw1 has an item with this id but it's currently unknown what it is

   0164  a_bridge
         bridge 3d object. texture to use comes from "flags" field. when the
         value is < 2, the bridge texture is taken from "tmobj.gr", index
         30 + flags. for this bridge, string block 0001, string 171 is printed
         as "look" description.

         when the "flags" value is > 2, flags-2 is used as index into the
         floor texture mapping (shared floor+wall for UW2), effectively using a
         floor texture.

         bridges could be used to alter the fixed ceiling height.

   0165  a_gravestone
         3d grave stone object (obj 0x13). text for gravestone is stored in
         strings block 0008, indexed by "quantity" - 0x200. the index also
         serves as offset into the file "grave.dat" which gives a unique grave
         id. It is used for large gravestone images that are stored in
         "cuts/cs401.n01", one frame each, indexed by the grave id. texture of
         the gravestone is image "flags" + 28 from "tmobj.gr".

         the text printed when looking at it is determined by the "flags"
         field. gravestone/tombstone description text is from strings block
         0008, string 352 + flags.

   0166  some_writing
         wall decal; text is determined through "quantity" field,
         game strings block 0008. the texture used is determined from
         "tmobj.gr", image "flags" + 20 (?).

         the plaque description printed when looking at it is determined by
         the "flags" field. text printed is from strings block 8, 368 + flags

   0167  a_bed [uw2]
         3d object. The "owner" field determines the colour of the sheets and
         pillow. The sheets are colour (4*owner+5), the pillow colour
         (4*owner).

   0169  a_shelf [uw2]
         3d object. Texture is lower byte of flags + 36 from "tmobj.gr"

   016e  special tmap obj (tmap_c)
         wall decal; texture used is determined from the "owner" field and is
         an index into the texture mapping wall table.

   016f  special tmap obj (tmap_s)
         same as 016e, with the difference that the wall is recognized in
         collision detection, effectively providing thin walls that could
         be removed by deleting the object.

   017x  a_button, etc.
         3d object. buttons, switches, pull chains and levers, textured with
         images from "tmflat.gr". The texture index into tmflat.gr is the
         lowest byte of the item id (subclass id).
         Special link usually points to a trigger.
         Note that after pressing the button the itemid increases by 8, thus
         using the texture. of the closed button. I don't know if this
         behaviour is hardcoded or done via the trigger.

   01c9  a_fountain

   01ca  a_silver tree [uw1]
         animated objects; "owner" field determines current animation overlay

   01cf  a_moving door
         object that is used during opening a door


6.1.2  Traps and Triggers

   Traps are set off by triggers, which are triggered by the player coming
   near them. Traps can also be set off by switches or buttons, etc. All
   triggers contain tilemap coords in "quality" and "owner" field called
   trigger "target" coordinates. All triggers also have the "special link"
   set that points to the trap(s) to set off. If a trap also has the "special
   link" field set, then another trap is set off, allowing trap chaining.

   0180  a_damage trap
         player vitality is decreased; number of hit points are in "quality"
         field; if the "owner" field is != 0, the hit points are added
         instead. the trap is only set of when a random value [0..10] is >= 7.

   0181  a_teleport trap
         teleports the player to another level and tile; destination level is
         given by "zpos" (0 means current level), tile x/y coordinates
         are given in "quality" and "owner" fields.

   0182  a_arrow trap

   0183  a_do trap [uw1]
         a multi-purpose trap. the "quality"-field determines action to
         perform:
          action   description
          02
          03
          05
          18       bullfrog puzzle related; (special property is a link)
                   if not in level 5 (where the puzzle is), the trap just
                   prints "There is a pained whining sound.".
                   "owner" defines some subcode:
                   00/01: lowers/raises tiles
                   02:    increases x coord (?) (0..7)
                   03:    increases y coord (?) (0..7)
                   04:    resets bullfrog puzzle; prints "reset activated"

          28       (special property is a link)
          2a       starts conversation (uw1 starts a hard-wired conv., slot
                   0x19, the speaking "Door"
          32
          39       (not used in uw1)
          3c..3e   (not used in uw1)
          3f       ends game, shows end sequence

   0183  a_hack trap [uw2]

   0184  a_pit trap [uw1]
         not implemented in uw1, but used on 3rd level, as target for a use
         trigger that is associated with a check variable trap (map bug?)

         this is probably a bottomless pit that drops the player through to

   0184  a_special effects trap [uw2]
         this trap does 'visual' effects like earthquakes, or blurry vision.

   0185  a_change terrain trap
         the trap changes one or more tiles, according to the encoded info.
         the trigger's target coordinates describe the starting tile.
         TODO

   0186  a_spelltrap
         fields "quality" and "quantity" determine spell type.

   0187  a_create object trap
         creates a new object using the object referenced by the "quantity"
         field as a template. the object is created only when a random number
         between 0 and 3f is greater than the "quality" field value.

   0188  a_door trap
         opens or shuts a door when set off. the trigger "target" coords
         determine the tile with the door to open/close. if the door
         has an "a_lock" object associated, it is deleted. if there is no
         lock, a new lock is created, using the template lock linked to by the
         "sp_link" field. as the door points to a lock, there can't be another
         trigger associated with it.

	 the "quality" value decides if a door trap only opens, closes or
	 toggles doors.
	 1: try open
	 2: try close
         3: toggle door state

   0189  a_ward trap
         not used in uw1

   018a  a_tell trap [uw1]
         not used in uw1, implemented the same way as a ward trap

   018a  a_skill trap [uw2]

   018b  a_delete object trap
         deletes an object when set off. "owner" and "quality" of the trap
         determines tile the object is to be found, "sp_link" points to the
         object.

   018c  an_inventory trap
         the trap searches for an item in the inventory; when it is found, the
         sp_link'ed trigger is set off. the item_id is given by
         ("quality" << 5) | "owner". additionally, the zpos value must be != 0
         to enable the trap.

   018d  a_set variable trap
         sets a game variable; fields "quality", "owner" and "ypos" are
         combined to form a "value" that is used as variable index later:

          field   bits in value
          ypos    0..2
          owner   3..7     (bit 5 of "owner" seems not to be used)
          quality 8..13

         the "zpos" field determines which variable to set. if zpos is 0, a
         bit-field is modified and the index value indicates which bit to
         modify. the "heading" field determines the operation to perform:

          heading  operation    bit-field operation
          0        add          set bit
          1        sub          clear bit
          2        set          set bit
          3        and          set bit
          4        or           set bit
          5        xor          flip bit
          6        shl          set bit

         values are modified and kept in range 0..63 (0x3f).

         largest variable index in uw1 is 0x33, the only bit modified in uw1
         is bit 7 of the bit field

   018e  a_check variable trap
         the "value" from the set variable trap (018d) is also used here.
         the trap checks a range of variables, starting from "zpos" and of
         length "heading". if "xpos" is not 0, the variable values in range
         are added; if it is 0, the lower 3 bits of every variable value are
         shifted into the resulting value. here's some meta-C code to show
         how the check works:

         bool check_variable_trap(zpos,heading,value)
         {
            Int16 cmp = 0;
            for(Int16 i=zpos; i<zpos+heading; i++)
            {
               if (xpos != 0)
                  cmp += game_vars[i];
               else
               {
                  cmp <<= 3;
                  cmp |= game_vars[i] & 7;
               }
            }

            return di != value
         }

         The trigger associated with the trap is set off when the resulting
         value is not equal the "value".

         block 0009. The actual string number printed is (64*level + "owner")

   0191  an_experience trap [uw2]
   0192  a_jump trap [uw2]
         causes the player to get an upward velocity according to the quality

          class, different object sub-class)


6.2  Common object properties

   Object properties common to all items are stored in the file "comobj.dat".
   The number of object properties is determined by (filelen-2) / 11   (each
   entry is 11 bytes long).

   The first two bytes of the file contain unknown information. Each entry has
   the following format:

   0000  Int8    height
   0001  Int16   mass/stuff:
                 bits 0-2: radius
                 bit 3: 1 for npc's, 3d objects and misc. items (animated flg?)
                 bits 4-15: mass in 0.1 stones
   0003  Int8    flags
                 0/2: object in range [336, 368[ seem to be 3d objects

                 4: decal object (always 0 in uw1)
                 5: is set when object can be picked up
                 6: TODO unknown
                 7: is set when object is a container
   0004  Int16   monetary value
   0006  Int8    bit 0-1: TODO unknown
                 bits 2..3: quality class (this value*6+quality gives index
                            into string block 5
                 bits 4..7: TODO unknown
   0007  Int8    bit 0: TODO unknown
                 bits 1..4: type? a=talisman, 9=magic, 3..5=ammunition
                 but 5-6: TODO unknown
                 bit 7: if 1, item can have owner ("belongs to ...")
   0008  Int8    scale value (?) TODO
   0009  Int8    unknown2
                 bits 0-1: ?? TODO
   000A  Int8    bits 0-3: quality type 0-f
                 bit 4: printable "look at" description when 1
                 bit 5-7: TODO unknown

   Each possible value of "quality type" maps onto a group of 6 strings in
   block 4 from lowest to highest quality. Items which have a quality are
   always described as "a/an <quality> <item>", with the exception of group D
   which is for armour items which are grammatically plural even if there is
   only one of the object, e.g. "leather leggings".


6.3  Object class properties

   Object properties specific to a range of objects are stored in the file
   "objects.dat". The file contains several tables. Here is an overview:

   pos   size     desc                        entries   bytes per entry

6.4  Object combining

   In the Ultima Underworlds, when you `apply' certain objects to one another
   in your inventory a new object is created. For example,
   pole + strong thread = fishing pole. The mechanism for this is very simple
   and is controlled by the file "cmb.dat" in the data/ directory.

   This file contains a table of 3 16-bit words for each allowable
   combination: `source1', `source2', `newobject' in that order. 3 zeros mark
   the end of the table. The low 9 bits of each word is the object ID. If an
   object of type source1 is applied to an object of type source2 (or vice
   versa) an object of type newobject is created. The top bit of each of the
   source words indicates whether that object is destroyed in the process: if
   it is a 1, the object is destroyed. (It is always the case that at least
   one of the source objects is destroyed: you can't create something from
   nothing, at least not this way).


 +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


7  Conversations

   Conversations in Ultima Underworld are controlled using an assembler-like
   opcode-language that seemed to originate from Forth sourcecode. There are
   256 conversation "slots" available that can contain code (but doesn't need
   to). The field "npc_whoami" of the "Mobile object extra info" (see 4.2.3)
   decides which slot to take. If it is 0, a generic NPC-conversation is used
   instead.

   To persist conversation info, there are several places to store variables.

   * Quest Flags store infos needed by more than one NPC; they probably can be
     modified by the game, e.g. when something happens (killing Tyball). Think
     of them as global variables.

   * Private Globals store infos saved after exiting conversations. Sizes of
     this area are determined by the file "babglobs.dat".

   * Local Variables store infos during conversation. They are lost when
     conversation ends.

   * NPC infos are stored along with the NPC's data in the Master Object List
     and contain infos like npc_gtarg or npc_goal. See chapter 7.x for more.

   * Game globals are variables that are global to the game, e.g. game time,
     current dungeon level or player properties

   The conversation code can call "intrinsic" functions to use functionality
   built into the game, e.g. for bartering or player inventory access.


7.1  Conversation file format

   Conversations are stored in the file "cnv.ark". Note that in Ultima
   Underworld 2 .ark files are compressed. See Chapter 9.1 for details.

   The File header looks like this:

   0000   Int16   number of conversation slots in file
   0002   Int32   offset to conversation slot #0
   0006   Int32   offset to conversation slot #1
   ...

   If an offset is 0, the conversation slot is empty and no conversation is
   available. The name of the conversation partner is stored in string block
   0007, string number = (conversation slot number - 0x0e00 + 16).

   The conversation header looks like this:

   0000   Int16   unknown, always seems to be 0x0828, or 28 08
   0002   Int16   unknown, always 0x0000
   0004   Int16   code size in number of instructions (16-bit words)
   0006   Int16   unknown, always 0x0000
   0008   Int16   unknown, always 0x0000
   000A   Int16   game strings block to use for conversation strings
   000C   Int16   number of memory slots reserved for variables (*)
   000E   Int16   number of imported globals (functions + variables)
   0010           start of imported functions list

   (*) This number includes all variables not belonging to stack, e.g. unnamed
   globals, imported globals and private conversation globals.

   An import record describes imported functions and game global variables
   used by the conversation:

   0000   Int16   length of function name
   0002   n*char  name of function
   n+02   Int16   ID (imported func.) / memory address (variable)
   n+04   Int16   unknown, always seems to be 1
   n+06   Int16   import type (0x010F=variable, 0x0111=imported func.)
   n+08   Int16   return type (0x0000=void, 0x0129=int, 0x012B=string)

   After this table the code section follows.


7.2  Private global variables

   Each conversation has a set of private global variables that are saved
   across conversations. The initial size of the area is stored in the file
   "babglobs.dat". When a game is saved, the globals are stored in the file
   "bglobals.dat". The layout of both files is as follows:

   0000   Int16     number of conversation slot
   0002   Int16     size of private global data for that conv.(=n)
   0004   n*Int16   all globals for that slot (omitted in "babglobs.dat")
   ...              repeat until file end

   On conversation start the game globals listed in the import table is
   copied to the memory address in the private globals. At end of conversation
   they are copied back to the game globals.


7.3  Memory layout

   Conversation memory is set up at start like this:

   0000    local (unnamed) variables (may be empty, size nglobals)
   000n    game globals (copied on start) (usually 0x001f long)
   0020    private conversation globals (of size nprivglobals)
   0020+n  stack begin (ascends up)

   There may be unnamed globals that start at memory location 0. The game
   globals then start at a higher address (the exact positions of the game
   globals are noted in the "import records list".

   For the memory, a full range of 16-bit memory (64k) should be available,
   which gives plenty of stack memory.


7.4  Assembler language opcodes

   The conversation code is an assembler-like language with a set of opcodes.
   It runs on a 16-bit virtual machine with 3 dedicated registers:
      BP: the base pointer for the current function. this is an index into
          the main memory array. BP+n are local variables on the stack.
          BP-n are parameters passed into the function.
      SP: the current stack pointer. this is an index into the main memory
          array of the VM. Most operations reference the stack pointer.
      RV: result value for imported function returns. Can also be used as a
          general purpose register.

   The language set is described here:

   Opcode         no. immediate operands
   |   Name       | no. stack operands
   |   |          | | No. values saved to stack
   |   |          | | |  Action
   |   |          | | |  |
   00  NOP        0 0 0  do nothing.
   01  OPADD      0 2 1  push s[0] + s[1]
   02  OPMUL      0 2 1  push s[0] * s[1]
   03  OPSUB      0 2 1  push s[1] - s[0]
   04  OPDIV      0 2 1  push s[1] / s[0]
   05  OPMOD      0 2 1  push s[1] % s[0]
   06  OPOR       0 2 1  logical OR of top two values.
   07  OPAND      0 2 1  logical AND of top two values.
   08  OPNOT      0 1 1  logical NOT of top value.
   09  TSTGT      0 2 1  greater-than, nonzero if s[1] > s[0].
   0A  TSTGE      0 2 1  greater-than-or-equal.
   0B  TSTLT      0 2 1  less-than.
   0C  TSTLE      0 2 1  less-than-or-equal.
   0D  TSTEQ      0 2 1  equality. Nonzero if s[1] == s[0].
   0E  TSTNE      0 2 1  non-equal.
   0F  JMP        1 0 0  jump absolute. address is measured in words from the
                         start of the code.
   10  BEQ        1 1 0  branch on equal. Pop a value, branch relative if zero.
   11  BNE        1 1 0  branch on Not Equal. As BEQ but branch if the value
                         popped is non-zero.
   12  BRA        1 0 0  branch. Always branch relative to the offset address.
   13  CALL       1 0 1  call subroutine. Push the next instruction address and
                         jump to the absolute address (in words) given.
   14  CALLI      1 0 0  call imported subroutine. Argument is the function ID.
   15  RET        0 1 0  return from subroutine. Pop the return address off the
                         stack and jump to it.
   16  PUSHI      1 0 1  push immediate value onto the stack.
   17  PUSHI_EFF  1 0 1  push effective address onto the stack. The value
                         pushed is the current frame pointer address plus the
                         immediate operand. This allows local variables and
                         function parameters.
   18  POP        0 1 0  pop a value from the stack (and throw it away).
   19  SWAP       0 2 2  swap the top two stack values.
   1A  PUSHBP     0 0 1  push the current frame pointer onto the stack.
   1B  POPBP      0 1 0  pop the frame pointer from the stack
   1C  SPTOBP     0 0 0  new frame. Set the frame pointer to the stack pointer.
   1D  BPTOSP     0 0 0  exit frame. Set the stack pointer to the frame pointer.
   1E  ADDSP      0 1 *  pop a value, add to the stack pointer. Used
                         to reserve stack space for variables.
   1F  FETCHM     0 1 1  pop address, push the value of the variable pointed to.
   20  STO        0 2 0  store s[0] in the variable pointed to by s[1].
   21  OFFSET     0 2 1  array offset. Add s[1] - 1 to the effective address in
                         s[0], push this as a new effective address.
   22  START      0 0 0  start program.
   23  SAVE_REG   0 1 0  pop a value from the stack and store it in the result
                         register.
   24  PUSH_REG   0 0 1  push the value of the result register on the stack.
   25  STRCMP     ? ? ?  string compare.
   26  EXIT_OP    0 0 0  end program (?)
   27  SAY_OP     0 1 0  NPC says something. Print a conversation string (from
                         the stack).
   28  RESPOND_OP ? ? ?  respond (?)
   29  OPNEG      0 1 1  negate. s[0] -> -s[0].

   (*) ADDSP, of course, doesn't actually push anything onto the stack, but its
       effect on the stack pointer is of pushing as many values as its operand
       specifies.
   (?) I haven't yet encountered these in the wild, so don't know exactly what
       they do.


7.5  Text substitutions

   In text strings printed by SAY_OP or a imported function (like
   "babl_menu") there may be strings like @SS1 or @GS8 that are substituted
   with other text. The format of the "format string" is like this:

   @XY<num>[<extension>]

   X: source of variable to substitute, one of these: GSP
      G: game global variable
      S: stack variable
      P: pointer variable
   Y: type of variable, one of these: SI
      S: value is a string number into current string block
      I: value is an integer value
   <num>: decimal value
   <extension>: format: C<number>: use array index <number>

   For pointer variables, the num value determines the location of the
   pointer relative to the stack. It usually refers to variables passed
   to a function (since they were pushed onto the stack).

   For stack variables, the num value determines which stack value is taken
   from the current local variables. The value to take is basep + <num>

   For global variables, the value describes the globals position in memory,
   at the front where the imported game globals and private globals are
   stored.

   Example:
   @SS2 means: print string with string number found at basep + 2
   @PI-3 means: print int value pointed to by pointer at basep - 3
   @GS8 means: print string from global var #8


7.6  Intrinsic functions

   Each imported function has an ID (the argument of the CALLI opcode), and
   the "import table" (see above) usually imports all available functions,
   even unused ones. All imported functions have at least one argument, and
   the first one is the number of arguments additionally passed (some times
   this rule seems to be violated, e.g. function "babl_menu", see (*)
   below). First argument is always pushed last on stack. All values are
   passed by reference (as pointer to the actual value or array).

7.8  Quest flags

   There are quest flags that are kept during gameplay to implement
   interaction between NPC's. Flags can be get/set using get_quest() and
   set_quest() or during gameplay, triggered by actions. Here's a list of
   flags and their meanings (when no values for the flag are specified, 1
   means yes or true, and 0 means no or false):

7.8.1 UW1 quest flags

   flag   description

     0    Dr. Owl's assistant Murgo freed
     1    talked to Hagbard
     2    met Dr. Owl?
     3    permission to speak to king Ketchaval
     4    Goldthirst's quest to kill the gazer (1: gazer killed)
     5    Garamon, find talismans and throw into lava
     6    friend of Lizardman folk

           2: started quest to search the "writ of Lorne"
           3: found writ
           4: door to armoury opened

   flags 0..31 are stored in a 32-bit integer bit field, flags 32..35 are
   stored as Int8 values. See chapter 9.2. where the values are stored in the
   savegame.

7.8.2 UW2 quest flags

8  3d models

   These are stored within the executable (bad! bad!). From Doug Church, on
   the 3d models:

     We'd take a 3ds model, convert it to an internal ASCII format, and then
     run a "model builder" which would generate an inlined BSP tree for it.
     This would be expressed in a byte code, or, really, as a set of simple
     ASM like codes.  Things like "Vtx 56.7, 435, 35.3" or "Color 153" or
     "Norm 0.6, 0.8, 0.0, front04" or whatever.  Then, we used the Macro
     Assembler (well, Optasm, really) to generate a bunch of "db" statements
     out of all this, and give it a label, and put it in the data segment. 3D
     models were then drawn by calling a little "model interpreter" in the
     game, which was given the address of this data block, which it then
     interpreted. i.e. when it got to the byte for "Norm", it would fetch the
     normal, dot it verse the eye vector, and jump or not based on the sign.

   There is a table of 2-byte model offsets, with room for 64 models.
   Positions of the table differ, as there are several builds of the uw.exe,
   ultimau1.exe or uw2.exe.

     game  table start   first bytes   table base offset
      uw1  0x0004e910    b6 4a 06 40   0x0004e99e
      uw1  0x0004ccd0    b6 4a 06 40   0x0004cd5e  same models, different place
      uw1  0x0004e370    b6 4a 06 40   0x0004e3fe  ditto (reported Gerd Bitzer)

      demo 0x0004ec70    b6 4a 06 40   0x0004ecfe  uw_demo

      uw2  0x00054cf0    d4 64 aa 59   0x00054d8a
      uw2  0x000550e0    d4 64 aa 59   0x0005517a  another UW2 build

   There's also a model information table stored in the .exe file.

   [uw1] It starts at 0x0005f7e5 (in my uw.exe, md5sum:
   c64cc46fd8162c626135a6a19315d21e) and contains 4 bytes for each model
   (a total of 32*2 bytes).
   The layout is as follows:

     0000   Int8*3 Color table. These values are indexed by the "color" values
                   in the model, and are itself indexes into game palette 0.
                   Note that this table is NULL-terminated, so the table can
                   actually have the size 0-3 (this plays a role when indexing
                   into this table from the model)
     0003   Int8   Flags (unknown)


   [uw2] The model information table for underworld 2 starts at 0x0006908A
   in a UW2.EXE with base 0x00054cf0. Each table entry has 5 bytes

      0000   int8   high nybble unknown
                    low nybble contains number of valid color entries
      0001   int8*3 color table as before
      0004   int8


   Models are:

   Node list
   ---------
   Actual model data is stored as a list with various "nodes" that do
   different things. There also is a vertex array that is filled at start of
   the model, and then faces are defined, using points from the vertex list.
   The list is parsed every frame and tests are done if some faces have to be
   rendered or not (depending if the player sees the polygon or not).

   There are some data types that are used in the model node data. These are:

     Int16   a simple 16 bit unsigned integer
     Fixed   fixed point number with 8 bits before the fraction point (8.8)
     VertNo  vertex number; lowest 3 bits are ignored
     TexCo   texture coordinate; contains a 16 bit fractional texture coord.
     Color   A color value. This is an index into the 3 byte "auxpal" in the
             model information table. The correct
             index into the 3-byte auxpal is obtained by the following
             calculation:

             for UW1:
             (color - 0x2920) / 2 % c
             for UW2:
             (color - 0x2680) / 2 % c

             where c is the number of entries in the auxpal, which may be less
             then three.

   All data types use 16 bit values.

   Every model has a header that looks like this:

     0000   Int32   unknown (does not seem to change anything)
     0004   Fixed   extents X value
     0006   Fixed   extents Y value
     0008   Fixed   extents Z value
     000a           node entries follow

   In general, node entries look as following:

     0000   Int16   node id
     0002   n       custom node data (may be omitted)

   Here's a detailed description of all nodes, sorted after functionality:

   Misc. nodes
   -----------
     0000   end node
            just ends current list; also ends sort node sublists

     0078   define model center
              0000   Int16     node id
              0002   VertNo    vertex list index to use as origin (?)
              0004   Fixed     origin X coordinate
              0006   Fixed     origin Y coordinate
              0008   Fixed     origin Z coordinate
              000a   Int16     ???

            because of the limited resolution available for specifying object
            positions, the origin for model coordinates will typically need to
            be offset from the center of the collision volume. This parameter
            gives that center, in model coords.

   Vertex nodes
   ------------
   Vertex node entries just set up the vertex list that is later used to take
   points and draw faces (such as triangles, polygons, etc.)

     007A   define initial vertex
              0002   Fixed     vertex X coordinate
              0004   Fixed     vertex Y coordinate
              0006   Fixed     vertex Z coordinate

   Face plane checks
   -----------------
   Face plane checks exist to check if a following face has to be drawn or
   not. Usually a face normal vector is defined to verify. A length value
   is given to know how many bytes to omit in the node list.

     0058   define face plane, arbitrary heading (backface cull)
              0002   Int16     number of bytes to skip when not visible
              0004   Fixed     normal vector X coordinate
              0006   Fixed     distance "model origin -> face" X value
              0008   Fixed     normal vector Y coordinate
              000a   Fixed     distance "model origin -> face" Y value
              000c   Fixed     normal vector Z coordinate
              000e   Fixed     distance "model origin -> face" Z value
            after this node usually face info nodes follow

     0064   define face plane X
            Y and Z coordinates of normal vector is 0 (YZ plane normal)
              0002   Int16     number of bytes to skip when not visible
              0004   Fixed     normal vector X coordinate
              0006   Fixed     distance "model origin -> face" X value
            after this node usually face info nodes follow

     0066   define face plane Z
            same as 0064, but with Z coordinate (XY plane normal)

     0068   define face plane Y
            same as 0064, but with Y coordinate (XZ plane normal)

     005E   define face plane Z/Y
            X coordinate of normal vector is 0
              0002   Int16     number of bytes to skip
              0004   Fixed     normal vector Z coordinate
              0006   Fixed     distance Z value
              0008   Fixed     normal vector Y coordinate
              000a   Fixed     distance Y value

     0060   define face plane X/Y
            same as 005E, but with X and Y coordinates/values (in this order)

     0062   define face plane X/Z
            same as 005E, but with X and Z coordinates/values

   Face info nodes
   ---------------
   They just define a face (polygon) from some points of the vertex list.

     007E   define face vertices
              0002   Int16     number of vertices (=nvert)
              0004   VertNo    vertex list index for first point
              0006   VertNo    vertex list index for second point
              0008             and so on

     00A8   define texture-mapped face
            vertex u and v coordinates are stored as 0.16 fractional values.
            just divide by 65535.0 to get coordinates in the range [0; 1]
              0002   Int16     texture number (?)
              0004   Int16     number of vertices (=nvert)
              0006   VertNo    vertex list index for first point
              0008   TexCo     first vertex u coordinate
              000a   TexCo     first vertex v coordinate
              000c   VertNo    vertex list index for second point
              000e   TexCo     second vertex u coordinate
              0010             and so on

     00B4   define face vertices with u,v information
            same structure as 00A8, but without the "texture number" field.

     00CE   define texture-mapped face
            same data as 00B4

     00A0   define texture mapped face (shorthand)
            seems to be a quick way to define a face with 4 vertices and
            automatic texture coordinates; vertex list indices
              0002   Int16     ???
              0004   Int8      vertex list index 0
              0005   Int8      vertex list index 1
              0006   Int8      vertex list index 2
              0007   Int8      vertex list index 3

            The automatic texture coordinates for the 4 vertices are
            (normalised to the range [0; 1]):
            0.0, 0.0
            1.0, 0.0
            1.0, 1.0
            0.0, 1.0

     00D2   define texture mapped face (shorthand)
            same as 00A0 but missing the first Int16 field

   Sort nodes
   ----------
   Sort nodes are there to sort faces of a whole node list and the renderer
   can determine if the list has to be rendered at all.

     0006   define sort node, arbitrary heading
              0002   Fixed     normal vector X coordinate
              0004   Fixed     distance      X coordinate
              0006   Fixed     normal vector Y coordinate
              0008   Fixed     distance      Y coordinate
              000a   Fixed     normal vector Z coordinate
              000c   Fixed     distance      Z coordinate
              000e   Int16     left node offset (starting at 0010)
              0010   Int16     right node offset (starting at 0012)

     000C   define sort node, ZY plane
            the X coordinate values are assumed to be 0
              0002   Fixed     normal vector Z coordinate
              0004   Fixed     distance      Z coordinate
              0006   Fixed     normal vector Y coordinate
              0008   Fixed     distance      Y coordinate
              000a   Int16     left node offset (starting at 000c)
              000c   Int16     right node offset (starting at 000e)

     000E   define sort node, XY plane
            same as 000C, but with X and Y coordinates (in this order)

     0010   define sort node, XZ plane
            same as 000C, but with X and Z coordinates (in this order)


   Shading/Coloring nodes
   ----------------------
     00D4   define vertex shading values
            Build a table of shading information for each vertex.
            Note that the list generated by this command doesn't
            always have the same size as the vertex table.
            Also note that each model should only define this table
            once.

              0002   Int16     number of vertices (=nvert)
              0004   Color     base colour for Gouraud shading
              0006   VertNo    vertex list index for first point
              0008   Int8      dark value for first point
              0009   VertNo    vertex list index for second point
              000b   Int8      dark value for second point
                               and so on; if nvert is odd, read another empty
                               byte to have 16 bit word align

     00D6   introduce Gouraud shaded face
            switches on gouraud shading. The following faces use
            the color definitions set with the "define vertex shading values"
            (00D4) command

     00BC   define flat face shade
            Defines a flat shade for the next (or all following?) faces.
            The values given here are the same as in the shading table (00D4)
            so the same calculations and palette indexing rules apply here
              0002   Color     colour
              0004   Int16     shade (dark value)

   Unknown nodes
   -------------
     0012   ???
              0002   Int16     ???

     0014   ??? colour definition
              0002   VertNo    vertex number
              0004   Int8      c1 ???
              0005   Int8      c2 ???
              0006   VertNo    vertex number

     0016   ???
              0002   VertNo    ??
              0004   Color     ??
              0006   Int16     ??

     002E   ???
            This node influences how the next face is drawn. I'm not sure what
            it does exactly, but I'm sure that it switches guoraud shading off
            (and possibly some other mode on)
            It's used quite a lot in the Lotus Turbo Esprit model and only
            once in the table model (with data=0). Other than that it's not
            used.
              0002   Int16     ???

     0040   ??? seems to do nothing but introduce a face definition
     0044   ??? this one too
            no further node data

     00B2   ??? potential texid for following 00B4 calls
              0002   Int16     ???

     00BE   ??? seems to define 2 shades ?? refers to 2 model variables
              0002   Int16     var 1
              0004   Int16     var 2

   Door nodes
   ----------
   Doors appear to have a special set of nodes only used for door models.
   Portcullis might be determined by the first parameter of the 00BA command.

     004A   define translation
              0002   Fixed     vertex x position
              0004   Fixed     vertex z position
              0006   Fixed     vertex y position

          This defines a translation to apply to coming nodes. Note that z
	  and y seem to be swapped.

     00BA   render door submodel
              0002   Int16     Pointer to some initial set up data for the
	      	     	       door submodel rendering. Not sure what this
			       actually does. Possibly related to door angle
			       and visibility.
	      0004   Int16     Pointer to first model node of submodel to
	      	     	       render. Offset is relative to the location of
			       the current node (BA).

9  Miscellaneous stuff


   This section describes all miscellaneous data structures and things that
   didn't fit elsewhere.


9.1  Ultima Underworld 2 compression scheme [uw2]

   The second game uses a new compression scheme to crunch data in .ark files
   together. The file header has a slightly different format than in uw1's
   files:

     0000  Int16  number of blocks in file (=nblocks)
     0004  Int32  unknown (always 0)

   Now follow 4 tables, each one is "nblocks" long and consists of Int32's.

     Table 1: offset table
       absolute file offset to block
       an offset of 0 means the entry is not (yet) used

     Table 2: flags for the datachunk
       Bit 0: block should be compressed (always set in uw2)
       Bit 1: actually is compressed
       Bit 2: the chunk has extra space allocated in case the compression
              isn't as effective next time. The "available space" value is
              valid for such chunks.

     Table 3: data size
       this gives the actual space occupied by the chunks on disk, either
       compressed or uncompressed data size, according to the flags.

     Table 4: available space
       This is valid for chunks with extra space (bit 2 in table 2 set). It
       gives the total space available for the chunk in the archive file.

   A compressed block always starts with an Int32 value that is to be ignored.
   If a block is actually compressed, it can be divided into subblocks.
   Each compressed subblock starts with an Int8 number; the bits from LSB to
   MSB describe if the following byte is just transferred to the target buffer
   (bit set) or if we have a copy record (bit cleared). After 8 bytes or copy
   record, the next subblock begins with an Int8 again.

   The copy record starts with two Int8's:
   0000   Int8   0..7: position, bits 0..7
   0001   Int8   0..3: copy count
                 4..7: position, bits 8..11

   The copy count is 4 bits long and an offset of 3 is added to it. The
   position has 12 bits (accessing the last 4k bytes) and an offset of 18 is
   added. The sign bit is bit 11 and should be treated appropriate. As the
   position field refers to a position in the current 4k segment, pointers
   have to be adjusted, too. Then "copy count" bytes are copied from the
   relative "position" to the current one.


9.2.1  Savegame format [uw1]

   Savegames are stored in folders called "SaveN", where N is the number
   of the save game. Ultima Underworld only allows 4 save game slots. The
   folder "Save0" is used to store the files "lev.ark" and "bglobals.dat"
   during gameplay.

   The file "player.dat" contains the main character data. The first 220 bytes
   are encrypted with a rather simple xor algorithm. The first byte in the
   file is the starting xor value. The next byte is xor'ed with xorvalue + 3,
   and for each next byte the xorvalue is incremented by 3. A simple
   implementation in C is here (it is assumed that xorvalue already contains
   the first byte):

      // descramble data
      unsigned char incrnum = 3;

      for(int i=0; i<220; i++)
      {
         if (i==80 || i==160) incrnum = 3;
         data[i] ^= (xorvalue+incrnum);
         incrnum += 3;
      }

   Note that the initial "player.dat" file in the "data" folder isn't
   encrypted at all and doesn't contain the first xor byte.

   After decryption, the file contains the following:

   0000   14*char character name
   ...
   001E   Int8    Strength
   001F   Int8    Dexterity

9.2.2 Savegame Format [uw2]

   The player.dat of uw2 is encoded with a different scheme than the one of
   uw1. The encryption algorithm uses a block of magic bytes in combination
   with previous ciphertext and plaintext.

   File layout

   0000   int8    magic seed
   0001 - 037D    encrypted character data
   037E - eof     inventory data in plaintext

   Inventory Data:
   037E   Int8      Number of items in inventory + 1

   0383   Int8      Bit 5: Seems to be set when avatar fist picks up an item in
                           the world and stays set forever

   0386   Int8      Bit 6: Seems to be set when avatar has any items in the
                           inventory and unset when it is empty

   03A3   19*Int16  Inventory slots in the following order:
                    head to feet, left shoulder, right shoulder, left hand,
                    right hand, left ring, right ring, 8 general slots
                    ("left" means screen's left, ot paperdoll's left)
                    Bits 6-15 contains the item's index

   03E3   ?         Inventory Items. Same format as static objects from section
                    4.2 though bytes 2 and 3 (position and heading) are ignroed.
                    The first item is index 1, and the others increase normally.
                    Notice that all objects form through their "next" and
                    "sp_link" fields a single tree, wih it's root in object
                    index 1, even though they may be in different inventory
                    slots. This is consistent with the view, that the Avatar
                    acts as a container for all items in the inventory.

   How to set up the magic bytes:
   The magic bytes are always 80 (0x50) bytes. They are filled in 4 rounds
   with differing stride using and changing the magic seed (MS from now on).
   The algorithm assumes the MS to be stored in an unsigned 8 bit variable
   and will overflow on MS multiple times.

   Magic Array (MA) fill algorithm:

      MS += 7;
      for (i = 0; i<80; ++i)
      {
         MS += 6;
         MA[i] = MS;
      }
      for (i = 0; i<16; ++i)
      {
         MS += 7;
         MA[i*5] = MS;
      }
      for (i = 0; i<4; ++i)
      {
         MS += 0x29;
         MA[i*12] = MS;
      }
      for (i = 0; i<11; ++i)
      {
         MS += 0x49;
         MA[i*7] = MS;
      }
   Notes on filling the MA bytes:
     - not resetting MS between loops is intentional.
      - unlike the first two rounds, the last two rounds are cut short.
      - the algorithm to fill MA was derived from an assembly trace of
        Robin Whlers uw2edit.exe. He uses a round 0 before the first round
        which is subsequently overwritten. This first round only results in
        increasing MS by 7, thus the first line of the algorithm outlined here.

   Example:
   A magic seed of 0x98 results in the following MA:
       0 | dc ab b1 b7 bd 8d c9 25 d5 db 94 e7 41 f3 6e 9b
      10 | 05 0b 11 17 a2 b7 29 2f 6a a9 41 47 00 53 b0 5f
      20 | 65 6b 71 49 93 83 89 8f be 9b 92 a7 ad c5 b9 bf
      30 | c5 db cc d7 dd e3 e9 d3 24 fb 01 07 da 13 19 6d
      40 | 25 e1 31 37 3d 43 b6 4f 55 5b 61 ef 6d ff 79 7f

   Decrypting PLAYER.DAT:
   After setting up the MA, the ciphertext of the character (C) can be
   decrypted to the plaintext of the character (P). The ciphertext of
   0x037D bytes is split in blocks of 0x50 bytes, with the last block
   being cut short.

   Each block is decoded as follows, with ^ denoting a XOR operation:
     P[0] = C[0] ^ M[0]
     for (i=1; i<0x50;++i)
     {
        P[i] = C[i] ^ (P[i-1] + C[i-1] + M[i])
     }
   Notes on decrypting:
     - remember to account for the shorter last block
     - in terms of cryptography, this algorithm sucks. don't reuse
     - the algorithm is fully symmetric and can also be used for encryption
     - the algorithm was derived from an assembly trace of Underworld 2.

   Encrypting:
   As mentioned before, the same algorithm can be used to encrypt and decrypt.
   The trick is figuring out MS and MA. If an existing file is modified, MS
   and MA can be reused if the first letter of the character name is not
   changed. Otherwise a new MS and MA have to be calculated.

   Apparently the the MS can be calculated as
       0xAA ^ (first letter of character name), thanks Al_B from TTLG forums

9.3  Unknown files

   This section lists files with unknown meaning.

   skills.dat
   ----------
   The file contains infos about the skills in character creation for every
   class. First 0x20 bytes are unknown. There are 5 entries for each of the
   8 character classes. The first Int8 byte contains the length of one entry.
   Then follows as many Int8 bytes as the length tells. The bytes describe
   the skill the user can select. If the length is 1, the only skill given is
   auto-set, showing no selection.

   shades.dat
   ----------
   Contains 12 entries, 8 byte long each. When renamed to shadez.dat (or
   deleted) uw runs in bright colors all the time without using candles and
   such.

   sounds.dat
   ----------

   xfer.dat
   ----------
   The Underworld games use the (colour-index) translation tables in
  data/xfer.dat for the transparencies (each transparency index has a
  table). [The numbers here are an attempt to back-convert from the
  translation table to RGBA values using a hairy little program of my own
  devising. They look "about right", so I'm inclined to leave them.]

9.4  Error codes

   Ultima Underworld has some error codes printed out when the game
   unexpectedly quits. The format is Nxxx where N is an uppercase letter from
   B to F and xxx is a decimal number. Error codes:

      B: out of low memory   (1000h)
      C: out of EMS mem      (2000h)
      D: could not read      (3000h)
      E: could not write     (4000h)
      F: resource/internal problem

   Here's a list of all possible error codes and their occurance

   B001  couldn't alloc memory for "data/strings.pak"
   D002  couldn't read "data/strings.pak"
   D007  couldn't read "data/babglobs.dat"
   E001  couldn't write "save0/bglobals.dat"

10     Sound [uw2]

10.1   sounds.dat

   The file "sounds.dat" in the "sound" folder contains sound effect data.

10.1.1   sounds.dat [uw2]

   The file starts with an Int8 value that is the number of data entries in
   the file. Then 5 Int8 bytes for each entry in the file follow.
   It is supposed that the data may be midi commands to play back sfx.

10.1.2   sounds.dat [uw2]

   The file starts with an Int8 value that is the number of data entries in
   the file. Then 8 Int8 bytes for each entry in the file follow.
   It is supposed that the data may be midi commands to play back sfx.

      0000      int8: number of entries = 49 (0x31)
      0001+n*8  start of entry n
   <<TODO entries format>>

10.2   VOC files [uw2]

   VOC files contain sound samples in soundblaster voc format.
      BSPxx.VOC    cutscene speech
      SPxx.VOC     sound effect
      UWxx.VOC     guardian laughter

   There are numours discussions of VOC files freely available on the net.
   For a complete discussion of the format google it, look at
   http://www.wotsit.org/ or whatever. Here is the short version as used by
   Underworld 2:

   VOC file format

      0x0014        uint16   [O] offset to type 1 block
      [O]+ 0x0000   uint8    type, always 1
      [O]+ 0x0001   uint24   [S] sample size in bytes
      [O]+ 0x0004...         sample data

   sample format

      0x0000        uint8    [R] sample rate
      0x0001        uint8    [C] compression
      0x0002..[S]            pcm data

   the sample rate [R] can be converted into Hz by the formula

      Hz = (-1000000) / ([R] - 256);

   All samples of uw2 are mono samples. The samples I checked were uncompressed

10.3   XMI files

   XMI files contain the rules to generate random music.
